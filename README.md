# DataPen

*A C++ library for writing and reading streamed, dynamically typed data*

## Intro

`DataPen` is a C++ header library that contains several tools and utility classes to write and read objects in pure bytes. It allows objects to be used similarly to how `void*` are used in C, or simply for having a more type-free environment in C++.

## Usage

To use DataPen, just include the header files into your C++ project.

To make the test executable, in your terminal run `make all`
